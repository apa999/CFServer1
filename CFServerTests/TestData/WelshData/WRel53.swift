Thanks to their ongoing and collective feedback and input into the development of this framework and given the reach and scale of their collective portfolios, the framework is both designed and anticipated to support the vast majority of requirements. Consequently, other contracting authorities that were not specifically consulted in the development of this framework may nevertheless also deem the framework to offer a value for money procurement solution for their own requirements and may also use the framework. As of the date of publication of this notice our frameworks may be used by all contracting authorities in England, Wales and Scotland as defined by the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 as listed on:rn https://www.cpconstruction.org.uk/who-we-work-with/rn https://lse.lhcprocure.org.uk/who-we-work-with/rn https://www.scottishprocurement.scot/who-we-work-with/rn https://www.swpa.org.uk/who-we-work-with/rn https://www.welshprocurement.cymru/who-we-work-with/rn including, but not limited to Registered social landlords (RSL's), tenant management organisations (TMOs) and arm's length management organisations (ALMOs), local authorities and any subsidiaries and joint-venture vehicles of those local authorities, health authorities, councils, boards and trusts, publicly funded schools, universities and further education establishments, colleges, police forces, fire and rescue services or registered charities.rn LHC clients may add community benefit requirements in their call-off contracts from this Framework including but not limited to:rn - to generate employment and training opportunities for priority groups;rn - vocational training;rn - to up-skill the existing workforce;rn - equality and diversity initiatives;rn - to make sub-contracting opportunities available to SMEs, the third sector and supported businesses;rn - supply-chain development activity;rn - to build capacity in community organisations;rn - educational support initiatives.rn All organisations appointed will be expected to work with LHCPG and our clients to help identify, deliver and capture social value outcomes associated with the delivery of projects they are award through this DPS.rn Where a client may not have already set out any social value requirements, then LHCPG would expect the appointed company to raise this with the client and jointly seek opportunities to evidence social value on each project through available data and pre/post works surveying.rn The following metrics are examples of the social value outcomes implemented for RM DPS, however this is subject to change and a final suite will be discussed and applied as part of the onboarding and go-live of the DPS.
