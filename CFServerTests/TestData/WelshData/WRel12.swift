This period will extend to 15 calendar days for communication by non-electronic means. Applicants who are unsuccessful shall be informed by the Council as soon as possible after the decision has been made. Should additional information be required it should be requested of the addressee in section I.1). If an appeal regarding the award of the contract has not been successfully resolved, The Public Contracts Regulations 2015 provide for aggrieved parties who have been harmed or are at risk of harm by breach of the rules to take action in the High Court (England, Wales, and Northern Ireland). Any such action must be brought promptly (generally within 30 days). Where a contract has not been entered into, the Court may order the setting aside of the award decision or order the Council to amend any document and may award damages. If the contract has been entered into the Court may, depending on the circumstances, award damages, make a declaration of ineffectiveness, order the Council to pay a civil financial penalty, and/or order that the duration of the contract be shortened. If a declaration of ineffectiveness is sought, any such action must be brought within 30 days where the Council has communicated the award of the contract and a summary of reasons to tenderers, or otherwise within 6 months. The purpose of the standstill period referred to above is to allow the parties to apply to the Courts to set aside the award decision before the contract is entered into.","hasRecurrence":true,"recurrence":{"description":"2028"},"legalBasis":{"id":"32014L0024","scheme":"CELEX"}},"language":"EN","description":"Register your company on the eTenderWales portal (this is only required once):rn — Navigate to the portal: http://etenderwales.bravosolution.co.ukrn — Click the “Suppliers register here” link.rn — Enter your correct business and user details.rn — Note the username you chose and click “Save” when complete.rn — You will shortly receive an e-mail with your unique password (please keep this secure).rn — Agree to the terms and conditions and click “continue”.rn 2.
