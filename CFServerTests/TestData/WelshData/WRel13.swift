We understand the potential for collaborative investments with external stakeholders to make a positive impact on well-being.rn To align with the Trivallis commitment to well-being impact and community benefits, we have developed a Wellbeing Impact menu of options (Annex 5 of tender suite).rn The wellbeing menu of options is designed to support Trivallis in achieving our goals in delivering well-being impact values, in accordance with the requirements outlined in our business contracts.rn As part of the contract delivery, our contracted partners must implement Wellbeing initiatives equivalent to a specified percentage of the contract spend.rn As part of our tender process, we invite bidders to choose one or more options from the Wellbeing Impact Menu. These options represent the well-being initiatives that your organisation intends to pursue and accomplish as part of fulfilling the Trivallis contract requirements.rn The successful contractor will need to select one (or more) options from the Wellbeing Impact Menu to deliver in the first year of the contract.rn This contract has a potential duration of 6 years. For each year of the contract, on the anniversary date, the successful contractor is required to review and choose an option (or options) from the menu to deliver in that specific year once again.rn It is crucial to note that failure to select an option will render the tender bid non-compliant, resulting in exclusion from the tender process.rn Your response must detail how you propose to meet this requirementrn (WA Ref:148369)","links":[{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://api.sell2wales.gov.wales/v1?lang=cy/Notice?id=ocds-kuma6s-148369"}]}
