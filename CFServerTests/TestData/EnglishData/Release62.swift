"title": "Solar Canopy - Home Energy Transition (HET) Programme",
"description": "The London Borough of Harrow is inviting tenders for the provision of a design & build solution for the solar canopy renewable technology solution.   This forms one part of a proposed offering of three forms of photovoltaic provision that forms part of the H.E.T programme. The Solar canopy project provides an average Reduced Data Standard Assessment Procedure (RDSAP) uplift of 8 to 11 points, and targets dwellings which may be identified as not suited to traditional roof mounted solar PV due to roof size, orientation and obstacles. Furthermore, an approved resident referrals process forms part of this retrofit phase.rnrnThe London Borough of Harrow completed a successful growth bid as part of the wider decarbonisation programme plan for Energy Company Obligation [ECO], H.E.T and other major retrofit schemes in 2023. As part of this plan, the H.E.T programme will deliver a Â£4.5m programme of work, addressing key strategic drivers with retrofit interventions including a transition to low carbon heating and renewable technology, further to fabric works to circa 200 homes. rnrnHarrow's H.E.T implementation strategy sets out a clear delivery pathway across 3 years, significantly contributing to meeting Harrow's climate emergency directives and central government energy efficiency targets contributing to the roadmap to Net Zero, by achieving a minimum EPC rating of C initially with a fabric-first approach across all homes.  The programme will also be taking a number of properties to an EPC rating of B with a combination of additional energy efficiency measures.  The programme is set to deliver critical phases of Harrow's wider decarbonisation plan with the first milestone housing project to demonstrate a transition to low carbon heating, addressing fuel poverty with renewable technology integration.",
