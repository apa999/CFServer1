"description": "Submissions can be created and submitted up to the stated tender deadline. Once the deadline has passed submissions can neither be created nor submitted. It is not advisable for Suppliers to wait until the last moment before creating and dispatching a response in case of any last minute problems. Please note large files should be uploaded as early as possible to ensure transfer before deadline. If a Supplier is having problems uploading to the PCS site, then the University must be informed well in advance and depending upon the merit of the case, the University may arrange for the tender to remain open on the PCS system for a short period after the deadline time stated. System problems do not fall under the University’s remit and should be referred to PCS.rn Postbox Security: Postbox submissions cannot be accessed by anyone, including Millstream, (the provider of the Public Contracts Scotland system) until the deadline.rn Suppliers should note that when asked to complete a tender document, the document must be submitted in the file type in which it was issued (Word, Excel etc.). Files of any alternative type may only be used where documents are for attachment, rather than completion.rn Freedom of Informationrn The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, which came into force on 1 January 2005, designates University of Glasgow as a Scottish public authority and therefore subject to the provisions and obligations in that Act. This means that any person who makes a valid request for information held by University of Glasgow will be entitled to receive it, unless all or part of that information can be withheld by virtue of the exemptions in that Act.rn As part of our responsibility under the Act, University of Glasgow may be required to disclose any information held relating to your response to anyone who makes a request under that Act. Such information may only be withheld if it meets one or more of the exemptions or conditions in that Act. Even if an exemption is available University of Glasgow may nevertheless disclose requested information. Information held cannot simply be classified as “confidential' or 'commercial in confidence' to enable it to be protected from disclosure.rn University of Glasgow may publish the names and contact details of companies who have been issued with a Questionnaire on its website.rn Information may also be requested under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Environmental Information (Scotland) Regulations 2004.rn NOTE: To register your interest in this notice and obtain any additional information please visit the Public Contracts Scotland Web Site at https://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/Search/Search_Switch.aspx?ID=579933.rn The buyer has indicated that it will accept electronic responses to this notice via the Postbox facility.
