"minimum": "- ESPD (Scotland) Questions 4B.5.1, 4B.5.2, 4B.5.3 - Insurance Requirements It is a requirement of this framework that Candidates hold, or can commit to obtain prior to the start date of the framework, the types and levels of insurance indicated below: -Employers' liability insurance 5 million GBP in respect of each claim, without limit to the number of claims. -Public/Products liability insurance 10 million GBP in respect of each claim, without limit to the number of claims (but in the aggregate for products). -Statutory Third Party Liability insurance in accord with the provisions of the current Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended) to a minimum indemnity level of 5 million GBP in respect of each claim, without limit to the number of claims, but unlimited in respect of personal injury. Candidates must note that where a call off under the framework incorporates services requiring the design of security services or requires advice on the establishment of the service the Council may require Professional Indemnity insurance for the relevant call off. This will not form part of the selection criteria for access to the framework, but where applicable, will be requested at the point of call off. Where a call off incorporates a requirement for Professional Indemnity Insurance this will be conducted using the mini competition award procedures to allow the commercial rates submitted for that call off to reflect additional costs for obtaining and maintaining this insurance. Candidates must note that this level of insurance is required to be awarded onto the framework, however the level will be assessed with each individual Council for each call off and they may determine a different level is required. For Candidates who will sub contract parts of the business, the bidder will provide a letter signed by a person of appropriate authority confirming that the Candidate has ongoing arrangements in place to ensure that sub-contractors are appropriately insured. - ESPD (Scotland) Questions 4B.6 and 4B 6.1 - Other Economic or Financial Requirements The Candidate is required to confirm that a search of the Candidate against 'Equifax Protect' will not retu a 'Warning' or 'Caution' code or any neutral code, unless the Candidate can provide any other documentation which Scotland Excel considers appropriate to prove to Scotland Excel (acting within its permitted discretion under the applicable public procurement rules) that the Candidate does/would not present an unmanageable risk should it be appointed on to the proposed framework agreement. Candidates who do return a ‘Warning’ or ‘Caution’ code, or who cannot provide any alternative acceptable additional explanation or supporting information will be assessed as a fail and will be excluded from the competition. It is at the sole discretion of Scotland Excel as to whether to accept any explanation or supporting information as a suitable alternative. Candidates relying on the financial standing of a parent company who are unable to commit to obtaining a parent company guarantee will be assessed as a fail and will be excluded from the competition."
