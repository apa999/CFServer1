Within such reports, the risk of business failure is expressed as a score ranging from 1 -100. In the event that a company is determined to have a risk failure rating of below 30 i.e. that the company is considered to have a high risk of business failure, the submission will not be considered further. Where you are not registered on credit safe e.g. charitable organisations, new start companies and Sole Traders you are to submit 2 years financial accounts, including Profit & Loss Statement and Balance Sheet for consideration."
