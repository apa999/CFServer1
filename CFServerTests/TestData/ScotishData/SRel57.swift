"reviewDetails": "The Authority will notify economic operators who submitted a tender or (where no deselection notification has previously been made)applied to be selected to tender, of its decision to award the framework agreement which notification will contain among other information, a summary of the reasons why the economic operator was unsuccessful. The notification will incorporate a 'standstill period' of a minimum of 10 clear calendar days (or a minimum of 15 if the communication method used is not electronic) between the date on which the Authority despatches the notice(s) and the date on which the Authority proposes to conclude the relevant framework agreement. The bringing of court proceedings against the Authority during the standstill period will automatically continue the prohibition on entering into the framework agreement until the court proceedings are determined, discontinued or disposed of, or the court, by interim order, brings to an end the prohibition. The remedies that may be awarded by the courts before the framework agreement has been entered into include the setting aside of the decision to award the framework agreement to the winning tenderer(s). The bringing of court proceedings against the Authority after the framework agreement has been entered into will not affect the framework agreement unless grounds for the imposition of special penalties under the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015 can be established. Otherwise the remedies that may be awarded by the courts where the framework agreement has been entered into are limited to the award of damages. Economic operators are entitled to write to the Authority after receipt of the notification should they require further clarification. The Authority will respond within 15 days of such a written request, but it should be noted that receipt by the Authority of such request during the standstill period may not prevent the Authority from awarding the framework agreement following the expiry of the standstill period. Where an economic operator is dissatisfied with the Authority’s response to its request for clarification, or considers that the framework agreement has been concluded in breach of The Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015, such economic operator is advised to promptly seek independent legal advice.",

"description": "This Framework agreement will apply : NHS Fife . The estimated values referred to in Section II.1.5 and II.2.6 covers the twenty four (24) months contract duration and the two (2) optional twelve (12) month extension periods of the framework agreement. The buyer is using PCS-Tender to conduct this ITT exercise. The Project code is 13314. For more information see: http://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/info/InfoCentre.aspx?ID=2343 Community benefits are included in this requirement. For more information see: http://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/info/InfoCentre.aspx?ID=2361 A summary of the expected community benefits has been provided as follows: The Public Sector in Scotland is committed to the delivery of high quality public services, and recognises that this is critically dependent on a workforce that is well-rewarded, well-motivated, well-led, has access to appropriate opportunities for training and skills development,diverse and engaged in decision making. These factors are also important for workforce recruitment and retention, and thus continuity of service. Public Bodies in Scotland are adopting fair work practices, which include: A fair and equal pay policy that includes a commitment to supporting the Living Wage, including, for example being a Living Wage Accredited Employer; clear managerial responsibility to nurture talent and help individuals fulfil their potential, including for example, a strong commitment to Mode Apprenticeships and the development of Scotland's young workforce; Promoting equality of opportunity and developing a workforce which reflects the population of Scotland in terms of characteristics such as age, gender, religion or belief, race, sexual orientation and disability; Support for leaing and development; Stability of employment and hours of work, and avoiding exploitative employment practices, including for example no inappropriate use of zero-hours contracts; Flexible working (including for example practices such as flexi-time and career breaks) and support for family friendly working and wider work life balance; Support progressive workforce engagement, for example Trade Union recognition and representation where possible, otherwise alternative arrangements to give staff an effective voice. In order to ensure the highest standards of service quality in this contract we expect contractors to take a similarly positive approach to fair work practices as part of a fair and equitable employment and reward package. Please describe how you will commit to fair work practices for workers (including any agency or sub-contractor workers) engaged in the delivery of this contract. (SC Ref:578867)",
