"reviewDetails": "The Authority will notify economic operators who submitted a tender, of its decision to award the contract which notification will contain among other information, a summary of the reasons why the economic operator was unsuccessful. The notification will incorporate a 'standstill period' of a minimum of 10 clear calendar days (or a minimum of 15 if the communication method used is not electronic) between the date on which the Authority dispatches the notice and the date on which the Authority proposes to make an award pursuant to this procurement. The bringing of court proceedings against the Authority during the standstill period will automatically continue the prohibition on entering into the contract until the court proceedings are determined, discontinued or disposed of, or the court, by interim order, brings to an end the prohibition. The remedies that may be awarded by the courts before the contract has been entered into include the setting aside of the decision to award the contract to the winning tenderer. The bringing of court proceedings against the Authority after the contract has been entered into will not affect the contract unless grounds for the imposition of special penalties under the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015 can be established. Otherwise the remedies that may be awarded by the courts where the contract has been entered into are limited to the award of damages. Economic operators are entitled to write to the Authority after receipt of the notification should they require further clarification. The Authority will respond within 15 days of such a written request, but it should be noted that receipt by the Authority of such request during the standstill period may not prevent the Authority from awarding the contract following the expiry of the standstill period. Where an economic operator is dissatisfied with the Authority’s response to its request for clarification, or considers that the contract has been concluded in breach of The Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015, such economic operator is advised to promptly seek independent legal advice.",
