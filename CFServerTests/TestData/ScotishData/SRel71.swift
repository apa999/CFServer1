The Authority is obliged to comply with the regulations and any eligible economic operator can bring an action in the Sherriff Court or the Court of Session where as a consequence of a breach by the Authority, suffers or risks suffering loss or damage. The bringing of court proceedings during the standstill period means that the Authority must not enter into the contract, conclude the framework agreement or establish the dynamic purchasing system unless the proceedings are determined, discontinued or disposed of: or the court, by interim order, brings to an end the prohibition. The bringing of court proceedings after the standstill period has elapsed and the remedies that are available to the courts are detailed in the Regulations. Economic operators can write to the Authority seeking further clarification on the notice, to which the Authority must respond within 15 days. Economic operators should seek their own independent legal advice when they consider it appropriate to do so.",
