Otherwise the remedies that may be awarded by the courts where the contract has been entered into are limited to the award of damages. Economic operators are entitled to write to the Authority after receipt of the notification should theyrn require further clarification. The Authority will respond within 15 days of such a written request, but it should be noted that receipt by the Authority of such request during the standstill period may not prevent the Authority from awarding the contract following the expiry of the standstill period.
