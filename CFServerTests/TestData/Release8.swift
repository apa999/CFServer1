"title": "The Development of a North West Skills Mapping Plan (Regional Skills Pilot: Cheshire West and Chester)",
"description": "Enterprise Cheshire and Warrington leads the growth of the Cheshire and Warrington economy through a powerful partnership between the private, public, and voluntary sectors. Our ambition is to be the UK's healthiest, most sustainable, inclusive and growing economy.rnrnWorking in collaboration with local government, businesses, educational institutes and other public, private and community sector organisations, we keep Cheshire and Warrington firmly on the map.rnrnEnterprise Cheshire and Warrington (ECW) is looking to appoint consultants to work with ECW and partners, including Cheshire West and Chester Council, the North West Net Zero Hub (NWNZH) and Net Zero North West, to deliver a comprehensive skills mapping analysis and action plan, which will consider what is needed to transition from carbon intensive related jobs to stable employment in the clean energy and related sectors. This work will map the existing workforce and skills needs for roles at risk in the energy transition against possible clean energy and related opportunities within the wider area to understand what local interventions are most successful in building the skilled workforce needed to meet the UK's Clean Energy Superpower Mission. rnrnGiven this is a North West regional pilot project, it is expected that the major focus of the existing skills and workforce mapping will be the Ellesmere Port/Cheshire West area due to the concentration of industrial emissions at the heart of the North West/North Wales industrial cluster, with the broader regional area in scope for mapping clean energy opportunities available for transition. rnrnThe successful bidder will be required to deliver services in accordance with all tender documents and the contract to be placed with the successful bidder. Tenderers are requested to study the specification in detail and ensure that the specified requirements can be met and thus your understanding of our requirements is reflected in your Pricing Schedule return. rnrnWe envision that the programme of work will be committed by end of March 2025, with draft plans submitted March-April 2025 (data and research findings and high level proposals for interventions submitted to Government), and Plans finalised May 2025 for review by government for decision on progression to Phase 2  rnrnIf you have any specific questions concerning this document or the process for submission of your proposal, then please email through to: tenders@cheshireandwarrington.com no later than Thursday 30th January 2025. Only questions submitted to this email address will be answered.  Queries received after this date will not be accepted and will not be responded to.rnrnTender submission deadline tThursday 6th February, 16:00",
