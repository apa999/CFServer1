"description": "***Modification of the Contract***rnContract Variation PS24190 001 has extended the contract term from the 11th March to 31st March 2025.rnrn***** THIS IS AN AWARD NOTICE, NOT A CALL FOR COMPETITION *****rnrnThe final date and time for the submission of bids is 22/10/2024 at 11:00rnrnDO NOT apply directly to the buyer.rnrnAll tender information MUST be submitted through the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal.rnrnBrief Description of RequirementrnrnThe aim of this work is to develop recommendations for future standards development to enable interoperable data sharing across a data sharing infrastructure for the energy system, based on a review of priority use cases and the existing standards landscape. The aim is to identify where existing standards could be applied, where they can be modified to meet the priority use cases, and to make recommendations where new standards are required.rn rnThe purpose of this work is to assess the standards landscape, conduct a gap analysis, and recommend next steps for the development of technical standards that will enable the interoperable exchange of data across various actors within the energy system. The sharing of data within the energy system will make a direct contribution to decarbonising the power sector by 2030 and enable several other policy objectives, including in energy equity and affordability, energy security, net zero, and economic security. However, the Digital Spine feasibility study, which included engagement with over 100 stakeholders, identified that insufficient data interoperability is a key barrier to data sharing within the energy industry. This work is a gap analysis reviewing existing and emerging technical standards for meeting the use cases identified by DESNZ, in order to recommend next steps for standards development, including where existing standards can be adapted to enable interoperable data sharing between energy system stakeholders and where new standards might need to be developed.rn rnObjectives:rn1.tReview the priority energy system use cases as specified by DESNZ to produce a set of data types that would be shared as part of a data sharing infrastructure. rn2.tReview existing or under development standards, including:rna.tStandardised data formats for each identified data type. rnb.tProposals on how to handle private data or data with specific IP sensitivity, highlighting if/how present standards are planning to treat these data while enabling key use cases and ensuring data confidentiality.rnPerform a gap analysis to identify areas requiring standards development to enable interoperable data sharing across a data sharing infrastructurern rnhttps://beisgroup.ukp.app.jaggaer.com/ and follow the instructions to register as a srnrnAdditional information: rnDO NOT APPLY DIRECTLY TO BUYERrnrnAll submissions will be assessed in accordance with the Public Procurement Regulations that apply to this opportunity.rnrnResponses must be received by the date and time in the tender documentation; responses received outside of the deadline or not sent via the Jaggaer eSourcing portal will not be accepted or considered by the Contracting Authority further for this opportunity, unless a system outage is experienced, to which the Contracting Authority will advise upon accordingly.
