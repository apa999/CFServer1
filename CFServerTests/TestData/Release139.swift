"description": "North West London Integrated Care Board (ICB) seeks the views of Providers in commissioning for the provision of local community beds (step-up, step-down rehabilitation) for a wide range of conditions which are located in acute, intermediate care and community facilities. The aim of the service is to provide medical, nursing, and therapeutic inpatient rehabilitation for patients that are registered with a North West London GP.rnrnThe objective is to provide multidisciplinary assessments of patients from the local Trust and discharge patients to the most appropriate setting via the trusted assessor team based at Northwick Park Hospital.rnrnIn 2017, NHS Harrow borough originally developed a new integrated care pathway for adults and frail elderly people to avoid hospital admissions, support early discharge and promote effective rehabilitation and reablement, wherever possible in a community setting. The main acute hospital, London North West University Hospital Trust, was consistently subject to increasing demands for rehabilitation and acute treatment beds.rnrnSince its inception the Intermediate Care Beds has provided a route for patients who have received Acute Care from both elective and non-elective procedures or treatment. Predominantly the Intermediate Care Beds have ensured that patients are not occupying Acute Beds for lengthy periods of time when their onward therapy needs can be met within this current service.rnrnAs North West London moved to managing their community rehabilitation beds capacity across the system, the beds commissioned by Harrow borough were opened up from patient's with a Harrow GP only, to patient's registered with any North West London GP.rnrnNHS NWL ICB and its partners all recognise the need to evolve this service to provide a wider range of nursing care services to patients.rnrnThe ICB is now exploring the opportunity to re-procure this service and is would very much appreciate the views and feedback from possible providers of the services.rnrnNorth West London Integrated Care Board is therefore undertaking a market engagement exercise via a Request for Information questionnaire (RFI).rnrnThis is a process designed to help North West London Integrated Care Board (ICB) form a view of the best way to commission the service; it is not the beginning of a tender exercise. A further tender advertisement will be issued at the appropriate time where required.rnrnTo access the documents and participate, please register and apply via Atamis e-sourcing portal:rnrnhttps://health-family.force.com/s/WelcomernrnNorth West London Procurement Services (NWLPS) is a Collaborative Procurement Organisation. The ICB has instructed NWLPS to act as their procurement representative, therefore, any communications during this market engagement stage is on behalf of the ICB. rnrnPlease complete your responses by 31st March 2025.rnrnThank you for your participation.",
